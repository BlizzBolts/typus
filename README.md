# Typus

> `Typus === Latin('type')`

## Introduction

Typus is a complete TypeScript type parser.

Typus accepts the input from source code(.ts), declarations(.d.ts) and TsDoc, and outputing a well formatted objects aka Document.

## Goal

Typus should be a fundamental tooling under TypeScript anaylize based tools.

## RoadMap
* list most use cases as possible
* fully tests for all the use cases listed
* ...


## Inspirations

I'm working on a document product which need API parsing for React Component and other TypeScript declarations.

[react-docgen-typescript](https://github.com/styleguidist/react-docgen-typescript) can not handle normal TypeScript functions well.

So I made my own.
