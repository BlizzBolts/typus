# Typus

> `Typus === Latin('type')`

## Introduction

Typus is a complete TypeScript type parser.


## RoadMap


## Inspirations

I'm working on a document product which need API parsing for React Component and other TypeScript declarations.

[react-docgen-typescript](https://github.com/styleguidist/react-docgen-typescript) can not handle normal TypeScript functions well.

So I made my own.
